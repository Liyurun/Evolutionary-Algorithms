# Evolutionary-Algorithms(updating)
This is an open source optimization toolbox, including 17 optimization algorithms for population evolution for solution. It shows good performanceglobal optimization problem of single objective without gradient.

 All optimization algorithms are written in the simplest form to facilitate other developers to supplement and apply. Each algorithm has many sub-variations, and the original optimization idea of the designer is adopted as far as possible, although some improvements, the strategy is still useful. The genetic elite strategy toolbox is not reflected, hoewever in the simulated annealing algorithm to retain the tempering operation. All these operations are easily modified in the code, which is also the biggest feature of the toolbox, easy to develop and modify.The optimization algorithms lists as follow:
